# Fusion Game

## Description
This program is a simple fusion game between the two popular games, Connect 4 and Tetris. This game aims to overcome the limits of complexity that the original Connect 4 game struggles with by adding a layer of strategy with Tetris-like components.

## Installation Instructions
To use this app, download the latest version(Connect 4 + Tetris 2.9) and open it. This should run the code in the command console. If this does not work, the code can also be run with any Python-compatible software.

## How To Play Connect 4
This game is very similar to the board game Connect 4. If you already know how to play Connect 4, skip to the 'Additional Features' section.

Connect 4 is a 2-player board game in which players place pieces into cells separated into columns in a grid pattern. Due to gravity, pieces always fall to the lowest point in each column. To win Connect 4, a player must get 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Additional Features
The features that set this game apart from the regular Connect 4 game will be discussed in this section.

### Board Setup
My Fusion Game allows the user to choose how large the board will be, as well as how many in a row a player needs in order to win the game. This allows for interesting variations such as an 8x8 board in which the players need to get 5 in a row in order to win. If you would like to play with a regular board setup, simply press enter 3 times to skip past the board setup.

### Tetris
The Tetris Fusion functionality of my game removes all pieces on the bottom row of the board when the entire row is filled. This adds additional complexity to the game, which can add to the enjoyment of the players.
