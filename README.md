## How To Play Connect 4

Connect 4 is a 2-player board game in which players place pieces into cells separated into columns in a grid pattern. Due to gravity, pieces always fall to the lowest point in each column. To win Connect 4, a player must get 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
